Project Overview:
Analyzed 27 seasons of NBA player statistics (1996-2023) to uncover performance trends, compare basketball evolution across eras, and identify the true statistical MVP.
Using mySQL, I examined over 12000 player-season records to answer critical questions about scoring efficiency, era differences, team success patterns, and who truly deserves MVP recognition based on the data.
