-- Insights: 
-- Ethanol (E85) - Meaningful in Midwest (Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois) and it is supported by agricultural fuel blending programs.
-- Biodiesel - it has moderate presence in farm and trucking-heavy states (Texas, Iowa, Illinois). It is still small share overall, but relevant in logistics fleets.
-- Hydrogen - Extremely niche â€” only visible in California due to pilot hydrogen fueling network, practically zero elsewhere.
