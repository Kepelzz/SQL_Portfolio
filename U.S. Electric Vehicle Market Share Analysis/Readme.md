As part of my self-education, I have decided to analyse the growth and distribution of electric vehicles across the United States.
The dataset of my choice contains vehicle registration counts for multiple fuel types (EV, PHEV, HEV, gasoline, diesel, etc.) by state.
My goal is to uncover where EV adoption is happening fastest, how EVs compare to traditional fuels, and what insights can be drawn for policymakers and automakers.
